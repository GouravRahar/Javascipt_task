# Node.js Tasks

This repository contains solutions for three Node.js tasks:

1. Basic Node.js Server
2. Data Manipulation
3. Asynchronous File Handling

## Task 1: Basic Node.js Server

### Description
A simple Node.js server that listens on port 3000 and responds with "Hello, World!" for all incoming HTTP requests.

### Instructions
1. Open the `basic_server.js` file.
2. Run the server using the following command:

4. Access the server by opening your web browser and navigating to http://localhost:3000.

## Task 2: Data Manipulation

3. Run the script using the following command:
   
   ``` Node sum_of_array.js```

## Task 3: Asynchronous File Handling
